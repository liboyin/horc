TODO:
HOG with OpenCV
SVM classification with histogram intersection/chi square kernels
How to utilize color information?
Dimensionality reduction (at least we can remove the white background)
kNN is theoretically unstable in 128 dimensional space due to curse of dimensionality, but in practice, it is surprisingly accurate. Why?

Project Timeline:
Mar 27 [Libo]: Project proposal submitted.
Apr 11 [Libo]: Pseudocode with SIFT and kNN.
Apr 13 [Libo]: Prototype with SIFT and kNN on cosine distance. 80% accuracy. 
Apr 14 [Libo]: GitHub repo created.
Apr 14 [Libo]: Tried custom kNN metric function: dist(a,b)=cos_dist(a,b) * abs(a.sift_scale - b.sift_scale). 50% accuracy.
Apr 15 [Libo]: Migrated to scikit-learn framework. Experiment repeated 10 times on randomly train/test splits for stable result.

Demo due: May 18-29
Report due: June 1-12
