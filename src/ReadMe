All codes were written using Anaconda Python 2.7 and Matlab 2015a in Mac OS 10.10
All python files can be run as `python <filename>.py`
All parameter changes can be found inside the scripts.

Requirements:
1. Install python package `pylearngist` as described in https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyleargist/1.0.1
2. Python package `Keras` can be cloned from https://github.com/fchollet/keras
