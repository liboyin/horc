Household Object Recognition Challenge

This project is part of the Computer Vision course at ANU. We aim to train an image classifier that discriminates pictures of household objects, such as mugs, boxes, and toys. The given dataset contains 50 object classes, and four images are provided for each class. These four images are taken from different angles at the same well-illuminated object, with a clean, slightly reflective desktop background. Our final solution are based on SIFT, color histogram, GIST, and neural network.
